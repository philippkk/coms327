Assignment-0, Knight's touring

How to run:
	1. make
	2. ./tour

Description:
	1.5x5 board is init as 2D array will all values being -1,
	2.for each square on board run the recursive algo,
	3.the algo then loops through an array that tries every possilbe move that the knight can move in,
	4.if the move is valid, an array called result that keeps track of the output wanted gets the number of the square moved to,
	5.the spot moved to on the board is set to a number other than -1 to signify it has been moved to,
	6.the recursive function is called again,
	7.then the spot move to is set back to -1 for backtracking purposes.
finally the array named result will print out the resulting tour and the original for loop will run for every other spot on the board.

Bugs:
	none
