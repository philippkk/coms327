Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:17:11 -0600 - started grow algo, but made a mistake to have the seeds grow infinite up and down

Thu, 25 Jan 2024 13:02:45 -0600 - got the bug fixed now the growing works! will make a tweak to it though as well as add roads and mart

Mon, 29 Jan 2024 13:16:33 -0600 - finished gen and parameters working on path now

Mon, 29 Jan 2024 17:57:30 -0600 - finished path! now time to make pokemart and center to finish

Fri, 2 Feb 2024 23:20:04 -0600 - added north and south, had a fist fight with pointers and segfaults

Sun, 4 Feb 2024 19:46:38 -0600 - back working, got all directional commands working, now doing logic for keep consistent paths

Mon, 5 Feb 2024 21:36:27 -0600 - had a fistfight with fgets and realizing it takes the \n from the enter key

Mon, 5 Feb 2024 22:36:32 -0600 - finished fly! wasnt that hard but did have a little fight with string parsing. tomorrows task will be the edge cases, will probably just rewrite the whole path gen system

Wed, 7 Feb 2024 13:36:27 -0600 - finished the chance for buldings, that means im done !
