How to run:

How to clean:

Description:
	Running ./terrain will run the game

	The map will print first, next the cost to get to the player from every tile for the hiker
	then the price for the rivial

	The player will be the spot with the red background (or just colored depending on what youre running this on)
	

	logic: paths are generated using a weight map to find a somewhat organic path.
	buldings have a decreasing chance to spawn as we go farther from the center of the map
	all paths will connect to eachother, and on the edge cases the non edge paths and gates will be the only ones to spawn.
		ie. top right corner of map will only have left and down gate which will connect.
	All tiles are colored for style.
