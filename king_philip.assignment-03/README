Description:
	Running ./terrain will run the game
	
	General commands,
		n, move north, posy will go down
		s, move south, posy will go up
		e, move east, posx will go up
		w, move west, posx will go down
		f {x}{y}, fly to x,y. will move to pos x,y, pos ranges from -200 to 200
		q, quit, exit the game

	logic: paths are generated using a weight map to find a somewhat organic path.
	buldings have a decreasing chance to spawn as we go farther from the center of the map
	all paths will connect to eachother, and on the edge cases the non edge paths and gates will be the only ones to spawn.
		ie. top right corner of map will only have left and down gate which will connect.
	All tiles are colored for style.
