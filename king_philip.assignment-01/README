How to run:
	make
	./terrain

Description:
	Running ./terrain will print out the map of the game.

	The map in generated using seeds which then grow out if there is room
	next to them. The whole map is then filled that way.

	The paths are generated from a 2nd weight map that is generated at 
	the same time as the visual map. The path finds a low weight way to get
	to its exit.

	The mart and center and generated on a random path tile.

	Running terrain multiple times will result in different maps every time.
